## Overview <a name = "overview"></a>
This project was made within the organization of Checkmarx. Its purpose is to provide support for my activities as a trainee.
The samples folder represents the JS samples used in my analysis.

### Important Files and Folders <a name = "filesFolders"></a>
All main configurations are found in "index.js" and "/routes/tests.js" files.

The "/routes/tests.js" file displays the application's routes. They also contain comments in order to identify each of the vulnerabilities present in the application. Most routes have a vulnerable and a non-vulnerable (mitigated) version, with the "/sec/" represents all safe routes.

The "public" and "views" folders was created to demonstrate the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability:
- All ".ejs" files in the "views" folder represents a secure frontend using CSRF tokens produced in the backend.
- All ".html" files in the "public" folder represents a frontend vulnerable to CSRF.
